## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in various domains like healthcare, autonomous systems, and more. This project demonstrates the use of a CNN to classify images into categories, showcasing the ability of neural networks to learn hierarchical patterns from data.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Custom CNN architecture for multi-class classification
- Training, validation, and testing workflows
- Metrics evaluation including accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used contains labeled images across multiple categories and is split into training, validation, and testing subsets. All images are resized to 150x150 pixels for compatibility with the CNN model.

**Dataset structure:**
```
- train/
  - class_1/
  - class_2/
  - ...
- validation/
  - class_1/
  - class_2/
  - ...
- test/
  - class_1/
  - class_2/
  - ...
```

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is composed of the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction using filters
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions of feature maps
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevents overfitting
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Aggregates features for classification
- **Softmax Output Layer**: Produces probabilities for each class

Optimizer: `Adam`
Loss Function: `categorical_crossentropy`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Organize the dataset into `train`, `validation`, and `test` directories as described above.

## Usage

1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. Evaluate the model on the test set:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

3. Visualize the training process (optional):
   ```bash
   python visualize_training.py
   ```

## Results

The CNN achieved a test accuracy of **92.5%**, indicating its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Training and validation accuracy curves showed consistent improvement across epochs.

## Future Work

Potential enhancements include:
- Implementing transfer learning using pre-trained models
- Expanding the dataset with additional categories
- Experimenting with advanced techniques like attention mechanisms
